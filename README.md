# Berry_Blade

This project was made in the course Virtual Reality at UW - Madison. 
We worked on 4-member teams to design, plan, and create a VR experience or game. My primary task was to design the movement and the hand designs for the game. The other members worked on the environment, menus, and fruit physics.
Members: Zach, Ellena, Emili, Shantanu
